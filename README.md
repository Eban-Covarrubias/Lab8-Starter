How are graceful degradation and service workers related?

Service workers allow for data to load offline which can improve performace, but they also have a fall back in order to maintain graceful degredation and can also follow standard protocol to make sure that web pages are user friendly and functional even if certain features cannot be utilized. This means that in the case that a browser is not supporting a service worker, the page will be able to still load data online and maintain the basic functionality of the website.
